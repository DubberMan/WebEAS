# WebEAS
It's a EAS Endec made for the Web and applications




WebEAS is a lightweight, browser-based Emergency Alert System (EAS) encoder/decoder that was made on HTML. It's an open source software kinda similar to QuantumEndec, only difference being that this endec is made in HTML while the other is made in Python


It will be updated inconsistently.
